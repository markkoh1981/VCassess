Suggested we change narrative that we \"Found some more stock\" - because in this meeting when I spoke to them about our other whale-centric initiatives, they again harped on about how much they hate scalpers but they don't like it when the brand itself is attempting a cash grab. At least I bother to drink with them, which is basically causing a big shift of brand loyalty. They get the same attention at the private bank from their relationship manager. So I can see that my experience in previous part of my career is still consistent. The relationship with such high value customers do not rest with the brand\/company but with the point of contact.

Plus his plan to go into Hatyai is bearing fruit. He hinted that there is a benefactor involved and I'm trying to sniff out whether this is one of the existing whales, apparently all the Gunpla stores in bangkok have a single owner!

I need to clarify if this is a HIM thing, a WHALE thing or a THAI thing. I corroborated this with nut card and NX Gallery later - 3x3 binders \/ zipster seems to be the winning combination.",

Most of the conversation revolved around the new Whale sleeve campaign 2024 which Morten needed me to compile and I definitely wanted an accurate picture vs the last time. So I had to ask harder questions but had to time them carefully between the small talk. His consumption pattern has changed and this whale seems to have a bit of an emphasis on binders. I need to clarify if this is a HIM thing, a WHALE thing or a THAI thing. I corroborated this with nut card and NX Gallery later - 3x3 binders \/ zipster seems to be the winning combination.",

Whale kept fighting me for the bill but in true chinese style I managed to keep him from paying. There was also quite a bit of intel exchanged - Mox has now entered the philippines market. Animart is getting into a conflict with MMC (not great). And substantial pointers from both our distributor and the whale (Codename Mr M) for my whale program creation with Morten. Morten was made aware - it was certainly going to be a heavy bill because all singapore restaurants jack their prices up due to world cup. ",

Redirecting the whale would incentivise the shops that follow the rules, especially the premiums, in this case I need to push BGA's sales",

At this meeting I had a sinking feeling that if we announce that Great wave was reprinting we are going to lose quite a bit of credibility with Asian Whale players and I told Anders and Morten about this. Suggested we change narrative that we \"Found some more stock\" - because in this meeting when I spoke to them about our other whale-centric initiatives, they again harped on about how much they hate scalpers but they don't like it when the brand itself is attempting a cash grab. At least I bother to drink with them, which is basically causing a big shift of brand loyalty. They get the same attention at the private bank from their relationship manager. So I can see that my experience in previous part of my career is still consistent. The relationship with such high value customers do not rest with the brand\/company but with the point of contact. I told the former ceo of Force of will (Japan) this but he did not listen. Hope Morten does. ",
