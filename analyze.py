    You are a VC Analyst. Your task is to identify and evaluate potential synergies between a new pitch (Folder A company) and an existing portfolio company (Folder B company).

    **Portfolio Company (Folder B):** {portfolio_company_name}
    **Portfolio Company Details:** {portfolio_content}

    **New Pitch Company (Folder A):** {pitch_company_name}
    **New Pitch Company Details:** {pitch_content}

    **Synergy Evaluation Framework:**
    {synergy_criteria_text}

    **Instructions:**
    1.  Based on the details of both companies and the Synergy Evaluation Framework, provide an insightful explanation of potential synergies. Consider if the Folder B company could be a client, partner, etc., of the Folder A company, or vice-versa.
    2.  For each identified potential synergy, assess it based on the following categories (from the framework):
        *   **Synergy Type:** (e.g., Client Relationship, Channel Expansion, Technology Integration, etc. - pick from the provided list in the framework)
        *   **Feasibility:** (How easily can it be executed? Consider integration complexity, legal barriers, cultural fit.)
        *   **Scalability:** (Is this a one-off opportunity or a repeatable growth lever?)
        *   **Defensibility:** (Does the synergy create a moat? e.g., exclusive partnership, unique tech integration)
        *   **Alignment with Goals:** (Does this help the portfolio company hit its KPIs? e.g., revenue, market share, product roadmap)
    3.  Identify any **Red Flags (False Synergies):** (e.g., One-Sided Value, High Execution Cost, Strategic Misalignment - pick from the provided list in the framework if applicable).
    4.  Classify the overall synergy potential as: **Immediate Opportunity**, **Strategic Long-Term Play**, or **Low Priority**.
    5.  Provide a concise **Explanation for Introduction:** This explanation will be used in an email introducing the two companies. It should be compelling and clearly state the core reason for the introduction based on the most promising synergy.

    **Output Format:**
    Please structure your response clearly. For example:

    **Synergy Analysis for {pitch_company_name} with {portfolio_company_name}:**

    **1. Potential Synergy: [Describe the synergy, e.g., {portfolio_company_name} as a Client for {pitch_company_name}]**
       *   **Synergy Type:** [e.g., Client Relationship]
       *   **Feasibility:** [Your assessment]
       *   **Scalability:** [Your assessment]
       *   **Defensibility:** [Your assessment]
       *   **Alignment with Goals ({portfolio_company_name}):** [Your assessment]
       *   **Red Flags:** [e.g., None identified / or describe red flag]

    **2. Potential Synergy: [Describe another synergy, if any]**
       *   ...

    **Overall Synergy Classification:** [Immediate Opportunity / Strategic Long-Term Play / Low Priority]
