### **Final Score Calculation**
Each criterion is scored on a scale of 1 to 10, and the scores are weighted according to the percentages provided. The final score is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Final Score} = (\text{Team Score} \times 0.25) + (\text{Market Opportunity Score} \times 0.20) + (\text{Product/Technology Score} \times 0.20) + (\text{Business Model Score} \times 0.15) + (\text{Traction and Metrics Score} \times 0.10) + (\text{Financials Score} \times 0.10) + (\text{Risk Assessment Score} \times 0.10)
\]

The final score will range from 1 to 100, with higher scores indicating a more attractive investment opportunity.

### **Example**
If a startup scores the following:
- Team: 8
- Market Opportunity: 9
- Product/Technology: 7
- Business Model: 8
- Traction and Metrics: 7
- Financials: 6
- Risk Assessment: 7

The final score would be calculated as:
\[
(8 \times 0.25) + (9 \times 0.20) + (7 \times 0.20) + (8 \times 0.15) + (7 \times 0.10) + (6 \times 0.10) + (7 \times 0.10) = 2 + 1.8 + 1.4 + 1.2 + 0.7 + 0.6 + 0.7 = 8.4 \times 10 = 84
\]

Thus, the final score would be **84/100**.
