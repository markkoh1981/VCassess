**Detailed Investment Recommendations:**

1. **Investment Thesis:** We recommend investing in Zkagi, a high-performance privacy-deal network that implements true blue zkML innovations and practical zk-verified inferencing on open-source LLMs inside TEEs.

2. **Risk-Reward Profile:** We believe Zkagi offers an attractive risk-reward profile due to its:
	* Low $5 million funding round value (200k tokens left at 5M FDV)
	* High float, ensuring a liquid market
	* Devised low FDV and high float for effective launch and high growth potential

3. **Investment Stage:** We recommend investing in the private round, taking advantage of the bonus privileges offered to early investors, such as additional allocation and higher staking multipliers.

4. **Token Utility:** The token's utility is extensive, with rewards to compute providers, fees for end-user digital assistants/agents, and staking rewards in ecosystem AI coins and native tokens.

5. **Growth Potential:** Zkagi's partnership network (60+ partners secured), rolled-out base infrastructure and end-user product, and growing community of 100k+ across various socials demonstrate significant growth potential.
