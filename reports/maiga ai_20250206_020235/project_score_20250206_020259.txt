Based on the provided scoring sheet, I will evaluate the startup's opportunity using the following scores:

- Team: 8
- Market Opportunity: 9
- Product/Technology: 7
- Business Model: 8
- Traction and Metrics: 7
- Financials: 6
- Risk Assessment: 7

Now, let's calculate the final score:

\[
(8 \times 0.25) + (9 \times 0.20) + (7 \times 0.20) + (8 \times 0.15) + (7 \times 0.10) + (6 \times 0.10) + (7 \times 0.10)
\]

\[= 2 + 1.8 + 1.4 + 1.2 + 0.7 + 0.6 + 0.7 = 9.2
\]

Therefore, the final score is **92/100**.

This indicates that the startup has a strong foundation in terms of team, market opportunity, product/technology, and business model, but could improve its traction and metrics, financials, and risk assessment to increase its overall attractiveness as an investment opportunity.
