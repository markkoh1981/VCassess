It appears that the text is not in a coherent format, but rather a collection of fragmented sentences and phrases. However, I can try to make sense of it and provide a summary.

The text seems to be about a company's strategy to enter the South East Asian market as a B2B market player. The company aims to facilitate large-scale trade between countries in the region by connecting buyers with suppliers from multiple countries through various channels, including phone calls and chats on Telegram.

The text mentions that dentists often struggle to find unique products, making it difficult for suppliers to assist in emerging markets. However, D2D can effectively source rare and unique items for them, thanks to access to products from multiple countries through trade.

The company is advancing its technology by establishing a Telegram chatbot to make its business operations more convenient. It prioritizes its delivery service to ensure the best experience for customers, who often need their products quickly.

The text also mentions several dates (2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, and 2028) without clear context or explanations. It is unclear what specific events or milestones these dates represent in relation to the company's strategy or operations.

Overall, the text appears to be a rough outline of a company's plans for entering the South East Asian market as a B2B player, with a focus on facilitating trade and providing unique products to customers.
