**Investibility Potential Returns Analysis**

Based on the provided text, I have extracted relevant information to assess the investibility potential returns. The analysis is as follows:

1. **Stock Estimates**: Financial time estimates protein isolate ranges from $4,200 - $4,600 at tonne and soyabe protein isolate range is estimated at $3,500 per tonne.
2. **Industry Expertise**: The company has expertise in:
	* CEO
	* Co-founder
	* Strategy expert
	* Strategy technologist
	* Co-founder company liaison
	* Company co-founder commercialization expert
	* Co-founder technology expert
3. **Product/Service Overview**: Unfortunately, no specific details are provided about the products or services offered by the company.

**Investibility Potential Returns Assessment**

Based on the estimates and industry expertise, I would rate the investibility potential returns as follows:

* Protein isolate market growth: Moderate to High (Estimated $4,200 - $4,600 per tonne range suggests a significant investment potential in this area)
* Company commercialization strategy: Uncertain (Lack of information about specific products or services makes it challenging to assess the effectiveness of their commercialization strategy)
* Technological expertise: Moderate (The presence of technologists and experts indicates some level of innovation, but more information is needed to fully evaluate its impact on returns)

**Overall Investment Potential Returns**: 6/10

While there are moderate to high potential returns in the protein isolate market, the lack of specific information about products/services, commercialization strategies, and technological expertise makes it challenging to assess the full investibility potential.
