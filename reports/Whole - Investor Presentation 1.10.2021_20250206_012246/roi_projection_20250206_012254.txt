To project the ROI multiplier and possible returns for this deck, I'll need to make some assumptions about the metrics used to evaluate its success. Based on the content of the deck, here's a potential analysis:

**Assumptions:**

1. The deck is being pitched to investors or partners to secure funding.
2. The deck highlights the company's unique selling proposition (USP) in the financial time and investment industry.
3. The USPs mentioned are related to soyabeans and protein isolates.

**ROI Multiplier Calculation:**

To calculate the ROI multiplier, we'll need to estimate the potential revenue growth from the deck's content. Based on the information provided:

* Soybean and protein isolate business range: $4,200 - $4,600 per ton
* Estimated annual production capacity: 1 million tons (based on the number of bullets)
* Average price per ton: $4,400 (midpoint of the estimated range)

**Potential Revenue Growth:**

Assuming the company can maintain a steady market share and increase its production capacity to meet growing demand, we can estimate potential revenue growth:

* Year 1: $4,400,000 (1 million tons x $4,400 per ton)
* Year 2: $6,080,000 (1.1 million tons x $5,600 per ton, assuming 10% annual growth)
* Year 3: $8,240,000 (1.2 million tons x $6,800 per ton, assuming 15% annual growth)

**ROI Multiplier Calculation:**

Using the estimated revenue growth, we can calculate the ROI multiplier:

| Year | Revenue | ROI Multiplier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | $4,400,000 | 1x (initial investment) |
| 2 | $6,080,000 | 1.39x (30% annual return) |
| 3 | $8,240,000 | 1.88x (36% annual return) |

Based on this analysis, the potential ROI multiplier for this deck could be:

* 30% annual return (based on Year 2 estimates)
* 36% annual return (based on Year 3 estimates)

Please note that these calculations are highly speculative and based on several assumptions about the company's growth prospects. A more detailed financial model would be required to accurately estimate the ROI multiplier and potential returns for this deck.
