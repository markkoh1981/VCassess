This text does not appear to be a standard event listing or promotional material, but rather a collection of code snippets and contact information for a fictional company or organization called "Alfa Isal" ( possibly a typo or misprint).

However, I can try to help you make sense of it by highlighting some possible events or exhibits that might be mentioned:

1. **Booths**: The text mentions various booth sizes (e.g., 15 sqm, 8 sqm) and types (e.g., "starup corner" or "career expo"). This could suggest a conference, exhibition, or trade show where companies can set up booths.
2. **Gaming & Esports Partnerships**: The text mentions partnerships with gaming and esports organizations, such as Abdul Rahman Ibrahim @ Hawk.gg, which might indicate a partnership between Alfa Isal and a gaming company or organization.
3. **General Information & Inquiries**: The final section appears to be a general contact page for Alfa Isal, listing phone numbers and email addresses.

If you could provide more context or information about the intended purpose of this text (e.g., is it an event listing, a company brochure, or something else?), I'd be happy to help further.
