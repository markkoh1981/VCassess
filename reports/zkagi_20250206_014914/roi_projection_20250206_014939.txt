To project the ROI multiplier and possible returns for this pitch, I'll need to make some assumptions based on the information provided. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Tokenomics**: The token is named TGE (presumably for "TGE Token" or "zkAgi Token"), with an initial supply of 200 million tokens.
2. **Token Price**: Assuming a successful private round and listing on Solana Launchpad, I'll assume the token price will be $0.10 per TGE token (based on similar DeFi projects).
3. **Private Round**: The project has secured $5M in funding at a valuation of $25M, with 80% of that funding coming from new investors.
4. **Token Distribution**:
	* 60% of the total supply will be allocated to public sale (equivalent to 120 million tokens).
	* 20% will go to early investors and partners ($1.2M at $0.10 per token).
	* 5% to advisors and stakeholders.
	* 15% reserved for future partnerships and collaborations.
5. **Token Utility**: The TGE token has various utility cases, including:
	* Compute fees for AI models hosted on the network
	* Staking rewards in ecosystem AI coins
	* Rewards to compute providers
6. **Growth Potential**: With a strong community (100k+ members), 60+ partners secured, and a solid business model, I'll assume a growth rate of 20% per annum for the next three years.

Using these assumptions, here's a possible ROI projection:

**Scenario 1: Conservative Growth**

* Year 1: $0.10 per token (public sale) -> $2 million in revenue
* Year 2: $12 million in revenue (20% growth)
* Year 3: $28.8 million in revenue (20% growth)

Total Revenue: $40.8 million

* TGE Token Price (Year 1): $0.10 -> $0.50 (25x growth)
* TGE Token Price (Year 2): $0.50 -> $1.60 (220% growth)
* TGE Token Price (Year 3): $1.60 -> $6.40 (300% growth)

ROI Multiplier: 32x in Year 3

**Scenario 2: Aggressive Growth**

* Year 1: $0.10 per token (public sale) -> $5 million in revenue
* Year 2: $60 million in revenue (20% growth)
* Year 3: $144 million in revenue (140% growth)

Total Revenue: $199 million

* TGE Token Price (Year 1): $0.10 -> $1.00 (10x growth)
* TGE Token Price (Year 2): $1.00 -> $5.00 (400% growth)
* TGE Token Price (Year 3): $5.00 -> $20.00 (300% growth)

ROI Multiplier: 40x in Year 3

Please note that these projections are highly speculative and based on assumptions about the project's growth potential, token utility, and market demand. The actual ROI multiplier and possible returns may vary significantly depending on various factors, including market conditions, regulatory changes, and competition.
