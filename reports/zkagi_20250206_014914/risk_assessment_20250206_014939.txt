**Investibility Potential Report: Zkagi**

**Executive Summary:**
Zkagi is a high-performance privacy data network that leverages true blue zkML innovations and practical zk-verified inferencing on open-source LLMs. The project aims to revolutionize confidential computing by merging zero-knowledge technology with hardware acceleration on a decentralized GPU infrastructure (depin). We analyze the investibility potential of Zkagi, highlighting its key features, business model, tokenomics, and traction.

**Investibility Potential:**
We evaluate Zkagi's investibility potential based on the following factors:

1. **Technology and Innovation:** 8/10
Zkagi's focus on confidential computing and zkML innovations has the potential to disrupt the AI and blockchain industries.
2. **Scalability and Performance:** 9/10
The project's use of a decentralized GPU infrastructure (depin) suggests high scalability and performance capabilities.
3. **Market Size and Growth Potential:** 8.5/10
The growing demand for AI and machine learning solutions, combined with the increasing importance of data privacy, presents a substantial market opportunity.
4. **Competition and Differentiation:** 7.5/10
While there are competitors in the confidential computing space, Zkagi's unique approach to merging zero-knowledge technology with hardware acceleration on a depin infrastructure differentiates it from others.

**Business Model:**
Zkagi's business model is primarily focused on direct revenue from on-chain AI agent usage and compute fees for AI models hosted on the network. Revenue sharing with partner projects using Zkagi APIs/agents and token utility rewards to compute providers, fee collection from end-user digital assistants/agents, and staking rewards in ecosystem AI coins and native tokens.

**Tokenomics:**
The project's token supply is limited, with 200,000 tokens available at the 5M FDV (Founding Distribution Value). Token unlocks occur at 50% every 3 months, with bonus privileges like additional allocation and higher staking multiplier for strategic input to private round investors & KOLs.

**Traction:**
Zkagi has secured over 60 partners, including Aethir Cloud and Autonomys, and rolled out its base infrastructure and end-user product. The project boasts a community of over 100,000 users across various social media platforms, with connections to 2,000+ startups in EU, NA, and Asia.

**Conclusion:**
Zkagi presents an attractive investibility potential, leveraging innovative technology, scalability, and market growth opportunities. However, the competitive landscape and execution risks should be carefully considered before making any investment decisions.
