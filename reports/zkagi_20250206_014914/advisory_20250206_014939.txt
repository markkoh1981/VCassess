Based on the provided advisory considerations and the project proposal for ðŸš€zkagi, I will assess its suitability for an advisory deal.

**Alignment with Goals:**
The project's vision aligns with decentralization, user empowerment, and blockchain innovation. ðŸš€zkagi aims to provide a high-performance privacy deai network, which addresses a clear need in the blockchain ecosystem. The project's goals are ambitious, but the proposal demonstrates a good understanding of Web3 principles and concepts.

**Tokenomics Design:**
The tokenomics design appears well-structured, with clear incentives for compute providers, end-users, and partners. However, I would like to see more detailed information on the token supply, distribution, and utility mechanisms. A deeper dive into the tokenomics spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_vdiixccknbg5pf7agtruld9mwkwppgvvlcovzf_aww/edit?usp=sharing) would be beneficial.

**Technical Guidance:**
The project's technical guidance appears sound, with a focus on hardware acceleration and decentralized GPU infrastructure. The integration with Solana Agent Kit (https://x.com/zk_agi/status/1871318401936703799?s=46) seems promising, but I would like to see more information on the security measures in place.

**Regulatory Compliance:**
The project appears to be aware of regulatory requirements, such as securities laws and AML/KYC. However, it is essential to ensure that the project has a thorough understanding of these regulations and has implemented adequate compliance measures.

**Strategic Networking and Partnerships:**
ðŸš€zkagi has secured partnerships with various organizations (60+ partners, including Aethir Cloud, Autonomys), which demonstrates an effort to establish a strong network. However, it is crucial to assess the depth and breadth of these relationships to ensure they align with the project's goals.

**Business Model:**
The business model appears solid, with multiple revenue streams (direct usage, compute fees, revenue share). However, I would like to see more detailed information on the projected revenue growth and profitability.

**Innovation and Originality:**
ðŸš€zkagi is working on a world-first project in confidential computing, which is an innovative concept. The integration of zero-knowledge technology with hardware acceleration has significant potential for growth.

**Growth Potential:**
The project's growth potential appears substantial, with a low FDV (200k) and high float. This could lead to effective launch and high growth potential. However, it is essential to assess the feasibility of these projections.

**Key Concerns:**

1. **Lack of detail in tokenomics:** While the proposal provides an overview of the tokenomics design, I would like to see more detailed information on the token supply, distribution, and utility mechanisms.
2. **Limited information on security measures:** The project mentions hardware acceleration, but I would like to see more information on the security measures in place to protect users' data and prevent potential vulnerabilities.
3. **Assessment of partnerships:** While ðŸš€zkagi has secured partnerships with various organizations, it is essential to assess the depth and breadth of these relationships to ensure they align with the project's goals.

**Advisory Deal Suitability:**
Based on the assessment, I would recommend an advisory deal for ðŸš€zkagi. The project demonstrates a good understanding of Web3 principles and concepts, and its innovative approach to confidential computing has significant potential for growth. However, it is essential to address the concerns mentioned above through further research, due diligence, and consultation with experts.

**Recommendations:**

1. Conduct thorough due diligence on the tokenomics design, security measures, and partnerships.
2. Engage with experts in Web3, AI, and confidential computing to provide additional insights and guidance.
3. Assess the feasibility of the projected revenue growth and profitability.
4. Develop a comprehensive business plan that outlines the project's goals, strategies, and financial projections.

By addressing these concerns and recommendations, ðŸš€zkagi can increase its chances of success and ensure a well-informed advisory deal.
