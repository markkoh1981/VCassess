Based on the provided information, I'll assess the suitability of maiga.ai for an advisory deal.

**Alignment with investor interests:** Mark G. Koh is keen on Gamefi and depin projects, and maiga.ai falls under both categories. The project's focus on providing AI-powered signals, alpha, insights, and automated trading for defai aligns with his interests.

**Unique value proposition:** Maiga.ai offers a unique "proof-of-trading" pot token model based on trading volume, which is the first of its kind in the industry. This innovation showcases the project's commitment to pushing boundaries and creating a new standard in the Web3 space.

**Tokenomics and blockchain technology:** The tokenomics design seems well-thought-out, with a total supply cap of 1 billion Maiga tokens and a vesting schedule that incentivizes long-term growth. The fees structure, including 0.3% fees from Maiga-ETH LP fees generated from trading volume, appears reasonable.

**Partnerships and core team:** Maiga.ai has secured partnerships with several prominent Web3 protocols and DAOs, demonstrating its potential for collaboration and growth. The core team consists of experienced individuals, including Victor Lee, Soon Lai, and Cindy Jin, who bring valuable expertise in various areas.

**Scalability and liquidity:** With support from multiple L1/L2 networks (Base Chain, Ton Network, Bera Chain, and more), maiga.ai has a solid foundation for scalability and liquidity. This will help the project reach a broader audience and increase its adoption rate.

However, there are some concerns:

* **Lack of transparency in fees:** While the fees structure appears reasonable, it's essential to have clear explanations and justifications for each fee component.
* **Risk of token inflation:** With 50% TGE unlock and 50% vested in Omaiga Option Token, there is a risk that the token supply could increase significantly if not managed carefully.
* **Dependence on partnerships:** Maiga.ai's success is heavily reliant on its ability to maintain and expand partnerships with other Web3 protocols and DAOs. This dependence introduces some risks.

**Advisory deal suitability:**

Considering the project's innovative approach, unique value proposition, and solid foundation in tokenomics and blockchain technology, maiga.ai appears suitable for an advisory deal. The core team's experience and partnerships will be crucial in guiding the project through its growth phase.

However, it's essential to:

1. Conduct thorough due diligence on the project's financials, token economics, and partnership strategy.
2. Evaluate the feasibility of implementing a more transparent fees structure.
3. Consider the potential risks associated with token inflation and dependence on partnerships.
4. Assess the project's scalability plans and infrastructure needs.

Given these factors, I would rate the suitability of maiga.ai for an advisory deal as **8.5/10**.
