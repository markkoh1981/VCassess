This is a JSON object that appears to be a spreadsheet export. I'll break it down for you:

**Overall Structure**

The data is organized into several sections:

1. **Sheet1**: This section contains the actual spreadsheet data.
2. **Sheet2-9**: These sections appear to be empty or unused.
3. **Sheet10-11**: These sections contain additional metadata and calculations, but not data.

**Sheet1**

This section contains a single row with multiple columns:

* `05-Dec`: a date label
* `Artist`: an artist name (Assannee)
* A text description of the situation:
	+ "Video"
	+ "There are currently THREE outstanding invoices for the Artist and in Thailand no one starts work without being paid upfront. I am struggling because she already bent her own rules and started. At this rate, none of the dragonisations will be completed and we do not want her to make a half hearted job."
* Several numerical columns with values:
	+ `20,032.89`
	+ `$821.35`
	+ `THB` (Thai Baht)
	+ `0.041`
	+ `SGD` (Singapore Dollar)
	+ `Dec-21`

The last column appears to be a link to an image or document.

**Other Sections**

* **Sheet2-9**: These sections are empty.
* **Sheet10-11**: These sections contain additional metadata and calculations, but not data.

Some notable observations:

* The spreadsheet appears to be organized around dates, with each row containing a date label and other information.
* There are multiple columns for numerical values, including USD (United States Dollar) and SGD (Singapore Dollar).
* Some columns appear to be linked to external resources or documents (e.g., the Wise payment link).

Overall, this data appears to be a record of financial transactions related to an artist's work on a project, with additional context and metadata.
