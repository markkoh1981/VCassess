A. Revenue/Customer Synergies
Client Relationship: Could the new startup become a customer of your portfolio company (or vice versa)?

Example: Your portfolio company sells SaaS tools, and the new startup needs those tools.

Channel Expansion: Can the new startup provide distribution (e.g., access to new markets, customer segments)?

Example: The startup has an enterprise sales team; your portfolio company can leverage it.

B. Strategic/Operational Synergies
Technology Integration: Does the startup’s tech complement or enhance your portfolio company’s product?

Example: APIs, white-labeling, or embedding one product into another.

Supply Chain/Supplier Relationship: Can the startup reduce costs or improve efficiency (e.g., raw materials, logistics, manufacturing)?

Shared Infrastructure: Can they share resources (e.g., cloud services, manufacturing facilities)?

C. Partnership & Go-To-Market (GTM) Synergies
Co-Marketing: Can they collaborate on campaigns, events, or content to amplify reach?

Joint Sales Efforts: Can they bundle products or cross-sell (e.g., "Recommended partners")?

Strategic Alliance: Do they share a common competitor or mission where collaboration strengthens positioning?

D. Knowledge/Resource Synergies
Talent/Expertise Sharing: Does the startup bring specialized skills (e.g., AI, regulatory knowledge) that your portfolio company lacks?

Data Sharing: Can they exchange insights (e.g., customer behavior, market trends) to improve products?


Feasibility: How easily can the synergy be executed? (Integration complexity, legal barriers, cultural fit.)

Scalability: Is this a one-off opportunity or a repeatable growth lever?

Defensibility: Does the synergy create a moat (e.g., exclusive partnership, unique tech integration)?

Alignment with Goals: Does this help the portfolio company hit its KPIs (revenue, market share, product roadmap)?

Red Flags (False Synergies)
One-Sided Value: The relationship benefits only one party.

High Execution Cost: Integration requires disproportionate effort (e.g., rebuilding tech stacks).

Strategic Misalignment: The partnership distracts from core objectives.

Actionable Output
After analysis, classify the synergy as:

Immediate Opportunity (e.g., ready-to-buy customer).

Strategic Long-Term Play (e.g., co-developing a new product).

Low Priority (minimal impact or misaligned incentives)
