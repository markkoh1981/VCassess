1. Liquid Vesting
At the heart of Liquify is the Liquid Vesting mechanism. Traditionally, tokens are locked for long periods due to vesting schedules, preventing flexibility for both initiators and investors. Liquid Vesting solves this by introducing synthetic tokens that represent the locked tokens.

These synthetic tokens allow:

Immediate liquidity: Investors can trade or hold tokens without waiting for the vesting period to end.

Flexibility for initiators: Project creators can raise funds earlier while maintaining a vesting structure.

How it works:

Synthetic tokens are issued when an allocation is created.

They can be traded anywhere or held by investors.

As vesting stages complete, synthetic tokens are exchanged for the real tokens.

2. Synthetic Tokens
Synthetic tokens are a unique feature of Liquify. They are temporary tokens that represent future vested tokens.

Key characteristics:

Tradeable: Synthetic tokens can be bought or sold on any platform, giving investors access to liquidity even before the real tokens are distributed.

Secure: Ownership of synthetic tokens guarantees the right to claim real tokens once the vesting schedule progresses.

1:1 Parity: Synthetic tokens always maintain a 1:1 value with the real tokens they represent.

Tokenization: Synthetic tokens digitize and tokenize an investor's allocation, creating a liquid and tradeable representation of their future vested tokens.

Example:
An investor holding 1,000 synthetic tokens of Hyperliquid (HYPE) will receive exactly 1,000 real HYPE tokens once the vesting schedule completes.

3. Key Features Overview
Liquify‚Äôs platform is built to simplify and enhance token vesting and allocation:

Automated Processes: Liquify minimizes manual intervention and errors.

Secondary Market: Synthetic tokens can be traded easily, ensuring liquidity throughout the project lifecycle.

Security and Transparency: Smart contracts ensure all transactions are secure and visible on the blockchain.

Liquify is a platform that lets you invest in private token deals before they launch (TGE) and trade them instantly. It‚Äôs designed to provide flexibility, transparency, and liquidity for both project creators and investors.

Traditional private token investments lock your funds until tokens are released (after TGE). Liquify issues synthetic tokens that represent your locked tokens, which you can trade immediately, giving you early access to liquidity.

Liquify is designed for:

Initiators: Project creators, venture capitalists, and validators.

Investors: Anyone looking to invest in early-stage blockchain projects.

Community VCs: Groups pooling resources to invest in private deals.

Investing
Browse available projects on Liquify.

Select a project that interests you.

Invest the desired amount before the funding deadline.

No, everything happens directly from your wallet. You remain in control of your funds at all times.
‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Never share your password, seed phrase, or private keys with anyone.

Synthetic tokens digitize and tokenize an investor's allocation, creating a liquid and tradeable representation of their future vested tokens. They can be:

Held until they convert into real tokens during vesting.

Traded immediately on Liquify‚Äôs secondary market.

You can claim your synthetic tokens that represent your share in the project. Once the vesting schedule begins, you can claim the real tokens at each stage.

For each project, initiators decide if KYC is mandatory for investing in that project.

Liquify supports various ERC-20 tokens, such as USDT, USDC, and more. Initiators can set a different token for investments for each project.

Yes, you can invest in as many projects as you like, provided you meet the requirements for each.

Yes, each project has a minimum investment cap, which is clearly stated in the project details.

If you miss the deadline, you will not be able to invest in that round. However, you can still participate in other projects or buy synthetic tokens on the secondary market anytime.

A 2.5% fee is applied to all investments conducted on the platform.

Trading
Synthetic tokens are ERC-20 tokens, giving you full flexibility. You can:

Trade them on Liquify‚Äôs secondary market using the platform's P2P order books.

Transfer them to others as gifts or payments.

Sell them on any platform or marketplace that supports ERC-20 tokens.

Use them in other DeFi features (e.g.: as collateral for lending & borrowing) or other dApps on top of Liquify. 

The choice is entirely yours!

If you sell your synthetic tokens, the buyer will have the right to claim the corresponding real tokens when the vesting schedule progresses.

Referral
